    <dt><b>Title</b></dt>
    <dd>Newton's Method and complex dynamical systems</dd>
    
    <dt><b>Abstract</b></dt>
    <dd>If you think there's not much left to be said about rational
    functions of a single complex variable, then try iterating one and
    analyzing the results.  This has, at any rate, kept a number of
    mathematicians busy for the past few decades.  In this talk, I'll make a
    particular example of Newton's method applied to find the roots of a
    polynomial in one variable in order to try and give you some idea of
    what the subject of complex dynamics is about.

    <dd>The Method of Infinite Repetition in Topology</dd>
    
    <dt><b>Abstract</b></dt>
    <dd>A cobordism is a compact manifold whose boundary is made up of two
    disjoint pieces. In general, cobordisms can be quite complicated, but
    somewhat surprisingly, once you remove one of the pieces of the boundary
    from an invertible cobordism, the result always has a simple form. The
    proof of this uses a technique of infinite repetition (sometimes called an
    Eilenberg swindle) which has also been used for many other applications in
    topology, including the Generalized Schoenflies Theorem. We will discuss a
    few of these applications and how they are related to the notion of groups
    (or groupoids) with infinite products. There will be lots of pictures!

    <dd>Wyld Weyl and Twisted Bruhat</dd>
    
    <dt><b>Abstract</b></dt>
    <dd>The Bruhat order is a partial order on Coxeter groups with many
    remarkable properties. It plays an interesting role in many different
    areas of mathematics including algebraic geometry, representation theory,
    and combinatorics. We will begin by introducing Coxeter groups (in
    particular dihedral groups and finite Weyl groups) and the definition of
    Bruhat order. After that, we will discuss how to create Bruhat-like orders
    which we call "twisted Bruhat orders." We will give a result that
    classifies all of the possible twisted Bruhat orders on a Coxeter group
    that arise in a manner similar to the Bruhat order. Throughout the talk,
    we will use the simple example of S<sub>3</sub> (the symmetric group on
    three letters) to illustrate the ideas presented.

    <dt><b>Abstract</b></dt>
    <dd>Homotopies are a continuous deformation of one object to another, e.g.
    coffee cup to a doughnut. In algebraic geometry, homotopies provide a
    (numerical) method for solving systems of polynomial equations. We will
    begin by introducing homotopies of polynomial systems and look at some of
    their basic properties. After looking at some example problems, we will
    use homotopies to intersect algebraic sets where the defining equations
    are not known explicitly.

    <dd>A tour of computable structure theory</dd>
    
    <dt><b>Abstract</b></dt>
    <dd>This talk will be a tour of computable structure theory, using
    equivalence structures as our tour guide. I will introduce equivalence
    structures and define some of the themes in computable structure theory,
    such as computable spectrum, index set complexity, and computable
    embeddings. I will also give some results in these areas as they relate to
    equivalence structures. No logic background will be assumed.

    <dt><b>Title</b></dt>
    <dd>Coupled Oscillators and Biological Synchronization</dd>
    
    <dt><b>Abstract</b></dt>
    <dd><p>At night, in certain parts of southeast Asia, thousands of male fireflies gather in trees at night and flash on and off in unison in an attempt to attract the females that cruise overhead. When the males arrive at dusk, their flickerings are uncoordinated. As the night deepens, pockets of synchrony begin to emerge and grow. Eventually whole trees pulsate in a silent, hypnotic concert that continues for hours.</p>

    <p>Fireflies are the epitome of a "pulse-coupled" oscillator system: they interact only when one sees the sudden flash of another and shifts its rhythm accordingly. Pulse coupling is awkward to handle mathematically because it introduces discontinuous behavior into an otherwise continuous model. In this talk, I will discuss the emergence of synchrony in a population of pulse-coupled oscillators and explain what it tells us about fireflies.</p>

in this area, focusing on the nonnegative and positive curvature setting.

    <dd>Cohomology of the unitary groups and Morse Theory</dd>
    
    <dt><b>Abstract</b></dt>
    <dd>The unitary groups have a pervasive presence in geometry and far
    beyond, and you shouldn't be amazed if a Google search for these two words
    alone returns more than a hundred thousand results. If popularity is not
    something that you might consider worthy of esteem then one should say
    that their rich structure is probably equalled only by the simplicity of
    their definition. This talk aims to explain the words in the title
    and then the title as a whole and give also a little, cute corollary of
    what will have been said up to that point. They say that after the cute
    corollary there's free pizza. Does it get any better?:)

<h3 id="axon">February 4, 2008</h3>
<dl class="abstract">
    <dt><b>Speaker</b></dt>
    <dd>Logan Axon</dd>
    
    <dt><b>Title</b></dt>
    <dd>A Short Tour of Algorithmic Randomness</dd>
    
    <dt><b>Abstract</b></dt>
    <dd><p>Combining computablility theoretic ideas and measure allows us to
    identify a collection of ``random'' binary sequences.``Random'' because
    they are unpredictable, incompressible, and effectively average. The
    digits of any one random sequence behave pretty much as a sequence of
    independent identically distributed random variables (taking values 0 or
    1).</p>
    
     <p>Effective randomness has been extended to the space of continuous
    functions on the real interval, a probability space under the Wiener
    measure. A sequence of random variables taking values 0 or 1 determines a
    random walk. Taking a random sequence (random as above) determines a
    sequence of random walks. Limits of random walks have a well established
    connection with the Wiener measure so it is no surprise that random
    sequences correspond with ``random'' functions.</p>
    
     <p>Recently some effort has been made to extend algorithmic randomness to
    the space of closed subsets of $2^{\mathbb{N}}$. Early efforts seemed
    unnatural and unsatisfying to some. Recently I have been trying to fit
    that work into the framework of probability theory for this space.</p>

    <dt><b>Title</b></dt>
    <dd>A Brief Look at the Dirac Equation of Physics</dd>
    
    <dt><b>Abstract</b></dt>
    <dd><p>Quoting Wikipedia, "In physics, the Dirac equation is a
    relativistic quantum mechanical wave equation formulated by British
    physicist Paul Dirac in 1928" that "provides a description of elementary
    spin-Â½ particles, such as electrons, consistent with both the principles
    of quantum mechanics and the theory of special relativity. The equation
    demands the existence of antiparticles and actually predated their
    experimental discovery, making the discovery of the positron, the
    antiparticle of the electron, one of the greatest triumphs of modern
    theoretical physics."</p>

	<p>This talk will explain, using math mostly understandable by engineering
undergraduates who learned what they should have in multivariable calculus and
linear algebra and differential equations, and with only a few references to
physics, how the use of things called spinors allowed Dirac to take the square
root of a second order differential operator, obtaining a first order
operator, and his equation.</p>

    <dt><b>Title</b></dt>
    <dd>Umbilics and Loewner's Conjecture</dd>
    
    <dt><b>Abstract</b></dt>
    <dd>We will discuss the connection between Carath\'eodory's conjecture on
    the minimum number of umbilical points present in deformations of a sphere
    and Loewner's Conjecture about the index of vector fields of the form
    $\partial_{\bar{z}}^n f$ for functions $f:\mathbb {C}\to\mathbb{R}$. A
    recent result of F. Xavier allows the index of such vector fields to be
    computed in terms of the set of eigenvalues of the Hessian of $f$ in the
    case $n=2$. A further result allows us to compute the index of such vector
    fields for $n \geq2$. </dd>

    <dt><b>Title</b></dt>
    <dd>Math Games People Play</dd>
    
    <dt><b>Abstract</b></dt>
    <dd>I'll give an overview of some math games, both in the sense of
    mathematical content of games which many people have played and in the
    sense of a mathematical technique to demonstrate certain properties. In
    the first part I will talk about a few of games I liked to play as a kid
    or still like to play now, such as 24, Set, Tic Tac Toe, and Dots and
    Boxes, all of which either have mathematical content, or promote
    mathematicial/logical reasoning. Tic Tac Toe and Dots and Boxes will serve
    as the transition into the second part of the talk, as they are games
    between two people in which each is trying to play in order to maximize
    their chance of winning. A game between two opponents, possibly with one
    having a winning strategy is a method of proof in mathematical logic. For
    example, an Ehrenfeucht-Fraisse game on two structures is a way of showing
    isomorphism or non-isomorphism, and a strong Choquet game can be played on
    a metric space with a winning strategy for player II if and only if the
    metric space is completely metrizable. </dd>

    <dt><b>Title</b></dt>
    <dd>Pictures of Commutative Algebra</dd>
    
    <dt><b>Abstract</b></dt>
    <dd>Commutative algebra is often thought of as a technical,
	non-pictorial version of algebraic geometry. However, when we consider
	the case of monomial ideals in polynomial rings, many algebraic
	properties can be illustrated with lattice diagrams and graphs. In this
	talk, we will first state some of the basic questions in commutative
	algebra. Using the combinatorial properties of monomial ideals, we can
	then create pictures to answers these questions in the monomial case. We
	will talk briefly about how monomial ideals provide information about
	general ideals, and hopefully end by introducing the core of an ideal.

    <dt><b>Title</b></dt>
    <dd>Goodsteinâ€™s Theorem and Incompleteness</dd>
    
    <dt><b>Abstract</b></dt>
    <dd>GÃ¶delâ€™s First Incompleteness Theorem guarantees the existence of statements which are true, but not provable, in Peano Arithmetic.  Goodsteinâ€™s Theorem was one of the first examples of an unprovable statement in number theory.  In this talk, we will prove Goodsteinâ€™s 1944 theorem, and outline a proof of Kirby and Parisâ€™s 1982 result that Goodsteinâ€™s Theorem is unprovable from PA.  In the process, we will cover some necessary background in the ordinal numbers; discuss a related result by Kirby and Paris concerning the killing of hydra; and attempt to set the 2007-2008 record for greatest integer used in a GSS talk.
