Number-theoretic consequences of ergodic theory
<p>&nbsp;</p><p /><h4>Abstract:</h4>
<p> Every real number can be written as a continued fraction. For example, pi = [3, 7, 15, 1, 292, 1, 1, ...]. We can immediately notice that, so far, 1 appeared three times, while 13 is not on the list at all. Is it true, in general, that 1 is going to come up more often than 13? To answer this and many more number-theoretic questions, we are going to explore the patterns of pi first numerically and then analytically using tools of ergodic theory.
