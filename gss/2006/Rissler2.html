<p /><h4>Title:</h4>
PseudoRandom Number Generators
<p />
<p /><h4>Abstract:</h4>
<p> How do you get a deterministic computer to give you a random number?  The answer is that you don't, but you can get them to give you numbers that "look" random.  We'll discuss some of the algorithms used in scientific computing to generate strings of psuedorandom numbers and how we distinguish the good generators from the bad.</p>
