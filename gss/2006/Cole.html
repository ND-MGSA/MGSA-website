Decidable and Undecidable Theories
<p>&nbsp;</p><p /><h4>Abstract:</h4>
<p>We say that the theory of a class of mathematical structures is "decidable" if
there is an algorithm for determining which first-order sentences are true of
all structures in the class. I will make this definition more precise and give
examples of both decidable and undecidable theories of familiar classes
of mathematical structures. The class of groups will be given special attention;
I will show how the existence of a finitely presented group with an unsolvable
word problem implies that the theory of the class of groups is undecidable.</p>
