Topology of Flag Varieties
<p>&nbsp;</p><p /><h4>Abstract:</h4>
<p>Associated to a semi-simple algebraic group over $\mathbb{C}$ there
are a collection of projective varieties called flag varieties. The
geometry and topology of these spaces is important both in
representation theory and algebraic geometry. I'll discuss some
examples of these, their cohomology rings, intersection theory
(Schubert Calculus), and their equivariant K-theory if there is time.
