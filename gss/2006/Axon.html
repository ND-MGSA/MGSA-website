Effective Randomness for Fun and Profit
<p>&nbsp;</p><p /><h4>Abstract:</h4>
<p>Generating a random binary sequence is as easy as flipping a
coin. Do this infinitely often and you get an infinite binary sequence
that is, in some sense, random.  Suppose instead that you start with an
infinite binary sequence and want to know if it is random.  A
probabilist might say, "All infinite binary sequences are equally (un)
likely and so they're all random."  This is kind of a boring answer.
Fortunately computability theory comes to the rescue and provides an
answer that is pretty interesting.  I will introduce some of the
central concepts of effective randomness along with all of the
computability needed to understand these concepts.
