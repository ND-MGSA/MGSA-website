<h3>Graduate Student Seminar, 4:00 pm April 30, 2007; HH229</h3>
<p /><h4>Speaker:</h4> Don Brower
<p>&nbsp;</p><p /><h4>Title:</h4>
Minimally Interesting
<p>&nbsp;</p><p /><h4>Abstract:</h4>
<p>The vagueness of the phrase ``simplest possible'' is shown
through the sometimes coinciding sometimes wildly diverging notions of
"prime model", a model which can be embedded inside any other model of
a given theory, and a "minimal model", a model which does not contain
any submodels of a given theory. Hijinks ensue. The highlight will be
the exhibition of a theory with no prime model and uncountably many
minimal models along with a proof of this fact due to Baldwin, Blass,
Glass, and Kueker.</p>
