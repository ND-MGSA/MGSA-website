<p /><h4>Speaker:</h4> Tom Edgar
<p>&nbsp;</p><p /><h4>Title:</h4>
Root systems for the infinite dihedral group
<p>&nbsp;</p><p /><h4>Abstract:</h4>
<p>Root systems and Coxeter groups appear in many areas of mathematics such as in  representations of Lie Algebras for instance. I will introduce Coxeter groups and root systems and then discuss them more deeply in the setting of dihedral groups. In particular, I will talk about root systems associated to the infinite dihedral group and some of the interesting combinatorics that arise from the root coefficients (such as generalized binomial coefficients). If time permits, I will also define moment graphs associated to dihedral groups and discuss their connection with root systems.</p>
