<p>Overview of selected topics in MRI physics, math, technology, medical
uses, and economics.  Also this talk is intended to give grad students
who haven't had much contact with the Fourier transform, including the
discrete form, and its applications, a feel for why it is so useful.
Not much math theory will be discussed; no real analysis.</p>
