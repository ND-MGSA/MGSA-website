<p /><h4>Speaker:</h4> Sasha Lyapina
<p>&nbsp;</p><p /><h4>Title:</h4>
The Variety of Lagrangian Subalgebras
<p>&nbsp;</p><p /><h4>Abstract:</h4>
<p>Lagrangian  subalgebras appear naturally in Poisson geometry
as  the "graphs" of a Poisson structure on  Poisson homogeneous spaces of
Poisson Lie groups.  In this talk we will look at the
set of Lagrangian subalgebras as a subvariety of the corresponding
Grassmannian. Following the
paper "On the Variety of Lagrangian Subalgebras" by Evens and Lu, we will
discuss the geometry of this variety in some important examples.</p>
