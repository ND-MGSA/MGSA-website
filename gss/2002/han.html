<p><h4>Title:</h4>Minimizing Polynomial Functions</p>

<p><h4>Abstract:</h4>
Several approaches can be taken to deal with minimization of gneral 
polynomial functions.  It is demonstrated that existing algebraic methods 
(Grobner bases, resultants, homotopy continuation methods) are 
dramatically outperformed by a newly proposed technique which involves 
sums of squares and semidefinite programming.  In this talk, I will review 
the algebraic methods which consider the critical points of the given 
target polynomial, then two semidefinite relaxation technique using sums 
of sqrares will be presented.
