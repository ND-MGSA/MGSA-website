<h3>Graduate Student Seminar, 4:30pm May 5, 2003, Hayes-Healy 231</h3>
<p><h4>Speaker:</h4>Dan Bates</p>
<p><h4>Title:</h4>The Basics of Numerical Algebraic Geometry</p>

<p><h4>Abstract:</h4>
I will begin by discussing the basic ideas of the field of numerical algebraic geometry.  Specifically, I will
describe some probability-one algorithms that may be used to find and classify points on a variety that is given by a
system of complex polynomials.  This numerical description is useful in many applications, a few of which will be
mentioned briefly.  In the time remaining, I will describe some of the numerical aspects of this method, including
some questions that I am currently investigating.
