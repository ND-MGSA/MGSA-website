<h3>Graduate Student Seminar, 4:00pm September 2, 2002, Hayes-Healy 229</h3>
<p><h4>Speaker:</h4> Prof. Dave Nicholls</p>
<p><h4>Title:</h4> Existence and Computation of Traveling Water Waves</p>

<p><h4>Abstract:</h4>
The equations of motion for ideal, free-surface fluid flows were written 
down more than 150 years ago and have challenged theoreticians and 
experimentalists ever since.  In this talk we will discuss these equations 
and some of the basic theoretical and numerical results for a certain 
class of solutions, the traveling wave solutions.</p>
