<p><h4>Title:</h4>Talkin' 'Bout Good Fibrations (and Other Aspects of Model Categories)</p>

<p><h4>Abstract:</h4>
In the study of homotopy groups of topological spaces, three kinds of maps are
particularly important: fibrations, cofibrations, and weak homotopy equivalences.
Viewing them as morphisms in the category of topological spaces, the ideas
behind them can be generalized to other categories, leading to the notion of a
model category structure.  The category of chain complexes of R-modules, for
example, has a nice model category structure relating to the study of
homological algebra.  In my talk, I will use these examples to motivate the
definition of a model category and show why it is an interesting structure to study.
