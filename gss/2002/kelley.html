<p><h4>Title:</h4>Algebraic constructions of LDPC codes</p>

<p><h4>Abstract:</h4>
One of the major goals in coding theory is to construct codes which reach the Shannon limit. "Codes on graphs" is a
main focus of current research, as existing Shannon-limit approaching codes may all be represented by graphs.  The
prime examples of codes on graphs are Low Density Parity Check (LDPC)codes.  Although they perform well empirically,
LDPC codes still lack efficient constructions which can guarantee certain parameters characteristic of good codes. In
this talk we will discuss how graph structure relates to code performance. This will include Tanner's bounds on the
minimum distance for general codes on graphs based on the eigenvalues of the graph. We will then survey known
algebraic constructions of LDPC codes based on incidence structures and Ramanujan graphs.
