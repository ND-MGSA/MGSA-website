<h3>Graduate Student Seminar, 4:30pm March 3, 2003, Hayes-Healy 231</h3>
<p><h4>Speaker:</h4> Elisa Gorla</p>
<p><h4>Title:</h4> The wonderful world of sheaves and sheaf cohomology</p>

<p><h4>Abstract:</h4>
I will start by explaining what a sheaf is and doing some examples of
sheaves that come up in algebraic & differential geometry, analysis, etc.
Then I'll give the definition of sheaf cohomology (I'll talk about the
more intuitive definition given by Cech) and show some computation,
concentrating on the first cohomology group of an algebraic sheaf.
The subject was chosen based upon an interview of a representative sample
of the grad student community.
