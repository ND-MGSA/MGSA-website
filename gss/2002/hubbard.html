<p><h4>Title:</h4>Operads: The Geometric Road to Vertex Operator Algebras</p>

<p><h4>Abstract:</h4>
Operads, or "systems with compositions", were first formally defined in the 
1970's by topologists to unify such problems as looking at iterated loop 
spaces, compositions of maps and commutativity in simplicial chain complexes 
[1]. By taking the geometric structure of a particular operad, one can induce 
classical algebraic  structures such as monoids, (associative) algebras, 
coalgebras and Lie algebras. One can also induce the structure of a vertex 
operator algebra (VOA)[2 & 3], which is a non-associative algebra first used 
to describe the largest order sporadic finite simple group (the Monster) and 
also found to have applications in Conformal Field Theory. We will first 
discuss what these operads are as well as examples of them and how they can be 
used to induce classical algebraic structures, then look at the operad that 
induces the VOA structures along with the basic parts of that structure.
