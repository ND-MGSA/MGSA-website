<h3>Graduate Student Seminar, 5:00 pm April 7, 2003, Hayes-Healy 231</h3>
<p><h4>Speaker:</h4></p>
<p><h4>Title:</h4>A Brief Introduction to the Index Theorem
</p>

<p><h4>Abstract:</h4>
I will introduce the notion of a genus from a topological view.  We will 
then see how the A^ genus can be viewed as the index of the Dirac operator 
via the Atiyah-Singer index theorem and how this can be applied to other 
issues, such as the existence of positive scalar curvature metrics.
