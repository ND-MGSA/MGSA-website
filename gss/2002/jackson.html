<h3>Graduate Student Seminar, 5:00 pm Tuesday, October 15, 2002, Hayes-Healy 229</h3>
<p><h4>Speaker:</h4>Dan Jackson</p>
<p><h4>Title:</h4>Rationality of the zeta-function of a hypersurface defined over a finite field</p>

<p><h4>Abstract:</h4> We will discuss the zeta-function of a hypersurface over a finite field and explore the role of p-adic analysis in the proof of the rationality of
this function.  With the exception of some facts from basic algebra, all of the required background material will be introduced. </p>
