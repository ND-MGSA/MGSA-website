<h3>Graduate Student Seminar, 5:00pm September 17, 2002, Hayes-Healy 229</h3>
<p><h4>Speaker:</h4>Rebecca Weber</p>
<p><h4>Title:</h4>Tree Hugging</p>

<p><h4>Abstract:</h4> My research deals with five structures, all of which can be
related to the complete binary tree (every node has two children;
"complete" means this goes on forever).  I will discuss these structures,
my goals in relating them to each other, and my main current approach
(automorphisms).  My few original results will be highlighted and made to
sound more significant than they are.  No background in logic will be
assumed.</p>
