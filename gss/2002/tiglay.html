<h3>Graduate Student Seminar, 5:00pm April 14, 2003, Hayes-Healy 231</h3>
<p><h4>Speaker:</h4>Feride Tiglay</p>
<p><h4>Title:</h4>The motion of an incompressible fluid  in two dimensions
</p>

<p><h4>Abstract:</h4>
The Cauchy problem for the Euler equations of hydrodynamics is well posed
locally in time. In two dimensions, the solution exists for all time. I
will try to sketch the basic ideas in a proof of the existence of
solutions for all time in two dimensions
