<p><h4>Abstract:</h4>
The question of the existence of Riemannian metrics of positive scalar on 
manifolds has come to involve a set of bordism groups, labelled R_n.
These groups both classify and play the role of obstruction groups 
for the existence of these metrics.  However, these groups are not known 
even in the trivial case, and my work attempts to make progress in 
estimating their size by looking at a particular homomorphism from R_n to 
a K-theory group.  Fear not - this story will be told as simply as 
possible.
