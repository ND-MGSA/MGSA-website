<h3>Graduate Student Seminar, 4:30pm February 3, 2003, Hayes-Healy

<p><h4>Speaker:</h4>Cabral Balreira</p>
<p><h4>Title:</h4>Spectral Analysis of Schrodinger Operators</p>

<p><h4>Abstract:</h4>
   In Quantum Physics, the movement of particles under a potential is
described by Schrodinger Operators. In this talk, we would like to address
the problem of non-recurrent motion in Quantum Physics. We will start with the 
basic notions of Spectral Analysis and a discussion of the Laplacian Operator. 
Our goals are to State Lavine's Theorem on repulsive interactions and discuss 
its possible extensions.
