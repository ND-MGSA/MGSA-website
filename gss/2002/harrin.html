<p><h4>Title:</h4>An Introduction to the d-bar Neumann Problem</p>

<p><h4>Abstract:</h4>
In several complex variables, we can characterize holomorphic functions as
the solutions to the Cauchy-Riemann equations (appropriately generalized
from one variable).  In order to understand the properties of holomorphic
functions, it is helpful to be able to "solve" the Cauchy-Riemann equations,
which amounts to solving a first-order partial differential equation.  The
first successful solution to this problem was Kohn's solution in the 1960's.
Kohn solved the problem by first solving an equivalent problem: the d-bar
Neumann problem, which was of independent interest in the theory of partial
differential equations.  I will attempt to provide a gentle introduction to
the d-bar Neumann problem in order to show how it can be used to "solve" the
Cauchy-Riemann equations.
