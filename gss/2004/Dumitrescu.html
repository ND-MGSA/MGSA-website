<h3>Graduate Student Seminar, 4:30 pm February 28; HH229</h3>
<p><h4>Speaker:</h4> Florin Dumitrescu
</p>
<p><h4>Title:</h4>
Super-facets of geometry
</p>
<p><h4>Abstract:</h4>
<p>I will talk about various approaches to supermanifolds, a concept that
generalizes the notion of manifold, motivated partly by physics, with
an emphasis on examples. To build the theory, one usually mimics the
classical constructions in geometry in a more or less formal manner,
whose role is still to be understood. The talk does not require any
specific background.</p>
