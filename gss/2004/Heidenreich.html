The Great Change: Mathematics at the Turn of the (Last) Century
</p>
<p><h4>Abstract:</h4> 
<p>In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, a great shift occured in 
mathematics.  Mathematicians thought differently about what the goals 
and techniques of mathematics should be.  Before the shift, research 
mathematics looked like a complex version of undergraduate Calculus 
(what's the deriviative of x^2 - x at the point...).  After the shift, 
research mathematics looked like a complex version of graduate Real 
Analysis (let X be a measure space and S be the sigma algebra of 
measurable subsets...).  Mathematics changed from being about something 
to being about nothing.  Specifically, it changed from being about 
particular things (solve *this* equation) to being about nothing 
*in particular* (anything that satisfies a certain set of axioms).  My 
talk will study this shift, the mathematical advances which motivated 
it, and the many arguments and name-callings it gave rise to ("That's 
not mathematics, that's theology!"-- Gordon).  In particular, we'll 
look at the Hilbert-Frege debate over what mathematical axioms and 
definitions are.  Frege argued that a statement is considered an axiom 
if its truth is beyond doubt (think of the Euclidean Axioms) and we 
should call a statement an axiom only if we're certain of it.  Hilbert 
said an axiom set was really a definition of a kind of mathematical 
structures (think of the group theory axioms as defining what a group 
is) and that this is how a mathematician should think of *any* axiom 
set, including the Euclidean Axioms.  Frege said Euclidean Geometry is 
"about" the Euclidean plane, and Hilbert said Euclidean Geometry is 
"about" any structure that satisfies the Euclidean axioms -- we must 
not say what.  As Russell put it, "Mathematics is the subject in which 
we don't know what we are talking about, nor whether what we are saying 
is true."
