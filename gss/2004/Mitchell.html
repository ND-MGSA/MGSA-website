<h3>Graduate Student Seminar, 4:00 pm March 21, 2005; HH215</h3>
<p><h4>Speaker:</h4> Abigail Mitchell
</p>
<p><h4>Title:</h4>
A scenic route to rook theory
</p>
<p><h4>Abstract:</h4>
<p>I will start by discussing matching theory, which is a thoroughly combinatorial
corner of graph theory with some nice applications to the real world.  As it
turns out, the problem of enumerating matchings in a graph can be translated
into linear algebra, where it relates to a lesser-known cousin of the
determinant.  Eventually, we'll get around to talking about rook polynomials.</p>

<p>Combinatorics is arguably one of the most accessible fields of mathematics; you
won't need any special background to understand this talk.</p>
