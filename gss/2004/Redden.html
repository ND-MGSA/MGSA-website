<h3>Graduate Student Seminar, 4:30 pm March 14, 2005; HH229</h3>
<p><h4>Speaker:</h4> Corbett Redden
</p>
<p><h4>Title:</h4>
For what n is R^n a division algebra?
</p>
<p><h4>Abstract:</h4>
<p>When n is 1, 2, 4, or 8, we have the reals, complexes, quaternions,
and octonions.  These are the only values of n where this happens.  We will
see how cohomology theories can provide a way to phrase and answer this
question by using something called the "Hopf invariant."
