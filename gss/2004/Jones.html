<p><h4>Speaker:</h4> Ben Jones

<p><h4>Title:</h4>
Geometry of Grassmanians
</p>
<p><h4>Abstract:</h4>
<p>The Grassman Varieties are fundemental objects in mathematics. They have
many aspects and arise in many contexts. I'll talk about their geometry:
Schubert varieties, topology and intersections theory of Grassmanians,
resolution of singularities for Schubert varieties. If there's time I'll
describe how Grassmanians arise in Enumerative Geometry.
