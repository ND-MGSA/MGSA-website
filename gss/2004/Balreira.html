<p><h4>Title:</h4>
Global Injectivity as a Topological Phenomenon
</p>
<p><h4>Abstract:</h4>
<p>We consider the problem of finding conditions under which a
locally invertible map has a global inverse. We begin with Hadamard's theorem
which states that properness is a necessary and sufficient condition to obtain
an inverse. We will investigate the complex case and state a result of Nollet
and Xavier on holomorphic injectivity and the Hopf map. Finally, we will
observe that connectedness is a key issue in proving injectivity.
