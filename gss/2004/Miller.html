<h3>Graduate Student Seminar, 4:00 pm April 18, 2005; HH215</h3>
<p><h4>Speaker:</h4> Sara Miller
</p>
<p><h4>Title:</h4>
A brief history of computability
</p>
<p><h4>Abstract:</h4>
<p>This talk will attempt to answer the question of what exactly it
means for something to be computable.  The usual answer given, that is, if you
can imagine that there is an algorithm for computing something, then it is
computable, is (understandably) unsatisfying.  I will describe a few of the
historic notions of computability, including partial recursion and Turing
computability, explain why all of the notions agree, and then give evidence for
why one should be satisfied with the usual answer.
