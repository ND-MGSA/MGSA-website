<h3>Graduate Student Seminar, 4:30 pm February 14, 2005; HH229</h3>
<p><h4>Speaker:</h4> Gang Zhou
</p>
<p><h4>Title:</h4>
The application of functional analysis in partial differential equations
</p>
<p><h4>Abstract:</h4>
<p>The theory of functional analysis is very beautiful. But when I studied it in my undergraduate classes
I always wondered why people spent so much time on building it. In this talk I will show some applications of it in PDE. I won't prove any hard theorems.
