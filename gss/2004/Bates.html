<h3>Graduate Student Seminar, 4:30 pm September 13, 2004; HH127</h3>
<p><h4>Speaker:</h4> Dan Bates

<p><h4>Title:</h4>
Polynomials in Practice
</p>

<p><h4>Abstract:</h4>
<p>Two years ago, I discussed some of the latest techniques for solving polynomial
systems numerically.  Last year, I gave everybody a "small dose of polynomial
history and culture".  Now, in the third installment of this very drawn out
k-part series (with 2&lt;k&lt;7), I will discuss how to use polynomials in practice,
i.e., on computers.</p>

<p>Basic to any software that manipulates polynomial systems is the internal
representation of the polynomials.  I will describe some of the ways that
polynomials are stored by computer programs (some clever, some not at all) and
will focus especially on the advantages of a representation known as the
straight-line program.  I will demonstrate some wonderful tools, known as yacc
and lex (or bison and flex for you open source people), that can be used for
parsing polynomials into straight-line programs.  If there is time remaining, I
will dazzle you with the concept of automatic differentiation.  Don't worry - I
will not assume any programming background!</p>
