<p><h4>Title:</h4>
Water Waves
</p>
<p><h4>Abstract:</h4>
<p>I will begin by discussing the Navier-Stokes equations for fluid movement.  Through some assumptions and simplifications, these equations can be used to describe water wave movement on the surface.  The key to solving this formulation is the Dirichlet-Neumann operator (DNO).  I will then discuss different ways of computing the DNO with both flat bottom and a variable bottom.  I will conclude with some remarks on attempts to study the inverse problem of finding realistic approximations to the bottom topography given the surface deformation and some other parameters.
