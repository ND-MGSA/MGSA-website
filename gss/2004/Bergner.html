<p><h4>Title:</h4>
An Introduction to Algebraic Theories
</p>
<p><h4>Abstract:</h4>
<p>The notion of an algebraic theory provides a basis-free way of
discussing algebraic structures such as monoids, groups, and commutative rings.
 In addition, an algebraic theory can be used to describe an algebraic structure
on a topological space.  This talk will include some (very basic) category
theory background, the definition of algebraic theories, and examples
illustrating how they provide a concise way of expressing algebraic structures.
 In particular, I will discuss the ways in which algebraic theories and a
generalization of them have been a useful tool in my research.</p>
