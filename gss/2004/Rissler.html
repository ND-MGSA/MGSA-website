<h3>Graduate Student Seminar, 5:00 pm January 31, 2005; HH229</h3>
<p><h4>Speaker:</h4> Matt Rissler
</p>
<p><h4>Title:</h4>
Why it's good to be random and discrete
</p>
<p><h4>Abstract:</h4>
<p>I will describe a few Cellular Automata and some of their uses.  Then we will move on to adding randomness to the situation, and use this to model interesting things that go on with Myxococcus Xanthus, namely rippling and fruiting body morphogenesis.  Since you can't really talk about Cellular Automata without them, there will be fun movies and toys.
