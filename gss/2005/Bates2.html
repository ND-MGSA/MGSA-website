<p><h4>Title:</h4>
 A new perspective of algebraic geometry
</p>

<p><h4>Abstract:</h4>
<p>Despite modest roots, algebraic geometry has blown up over the
centuries into a massive field that may be studied in many different ways.  For
the benefit of those unfamiliar with the subject, we will begin by covering a
variety of fundamental notions, although we may not have time to progress much
beyond the surface.  Hopefully, there will be ample time to give the flavor of
several branches within the field.  We will then discuss the emergence of a
new, numerical perspective and some of the benefits of that point of view.  In
an ideal world, there would then be time to discuss a new algorithm for the
numerical computation of the multiplicity of a zero-scheme.  No prior knowledge
of algebraic geometry will be assumed (and yes, the puns were thoroughly
intended).</p>
