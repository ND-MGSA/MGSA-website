<p><h4>Title:</h4>
Real Numbers and Randomness
</p>
<p><h4>Abstract:</h4>
<p><p>What does it mean for a real number to be random?  Quite a few definitions have
been offered.  For instance, one definition of a random real is based on the
Kolmogorov Complexity of the initial segments of its binary expansion.  Another
definition has been given in terms of effective measure theory.  A third
definition, one concerning certain betting strategies, has also been proposed. 
We explore each of these definitions, seeking to determine how they relate to
one another.  A few surprises may occur.</p>

<p>If time permits, we may even get our hands on a bona fide random real.</p>
