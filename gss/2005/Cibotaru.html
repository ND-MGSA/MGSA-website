<h3>Graduate Student Seminar, 5:00 pm January 23, 2006; HH229</h3>
<p /><h4>Speaker:</h4> Daniel Cibotaru
<p>&nbsp;</p><p /><h4>Title:</h4>
Knot theory and 3-dimensional manifolds
<p>&nbsp;</p><p /><h4>Abstract:</h4>
<p>Knot theory is a a very old and a very beautiful subject,   for which
a kaleidoscope of results has been proven but which, nevertheless, is far from
being a closed subject. This talk will be mainly about the relation of knots
with 3-dimensional manifolds, and the themes we have in mind are: the
classification problem, invariants (partial results to the classification),
gauge theory and knots.</p>
