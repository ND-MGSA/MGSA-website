<p /><h4>Speaker:</h4>Steven Broad<br />

<p /><h4>Title:</h4>A Conjecture of Calabi with Counterexample<br />
 <p />

<p /><h4>Abstract:</h4>
<p>In 1965, E. Calabi posed a conjecture that was shown to be false in a 1980
paper entitled, "A complete minimal surface in R^3 between two parallel planes"
by F Xavier.  This result is both beautiful and accessible.  En route to
demonstrating this result, we will introduce minimal surfaces and discuss some
elements of the rich connection between complex analysis and minimal surface
theory.</p>
