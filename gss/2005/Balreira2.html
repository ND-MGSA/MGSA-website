<p><h4>Title:</h4>
Topological Tools in Nonlinear Analysis
</p>
<p><h4>Abstract:</h4>
<p>It is quite surprising to see that Nonlinear Analysis rests, in a
striking and simple way, on basic ideas from Topology. Methods from fixed point
theory and degree theory are such examples. We plan to give a survey of these
topological methods and comment on the celebrated Mountain Pass Theorem.
Specific examples in Analysis will be discussed in the setting of global
invertibility problems.</p>
