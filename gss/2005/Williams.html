<p><h4>Speaker:</h4> Prof. Bruce Williams
</p>
<p><h4>Title:</h4>
Classification of manifolds
</p>
<p><h4>Abstract:</h4>
<p>The classification of 1-dim. and 2-dim. manifolds is easy.
Perelman may have recently used Differential Geometry to prove
conjectures of Poincare and Thurston.</p>
<p>This would be a fantastic advance in the study of 3-manifolds.
The theory of smooth 4-dim. manifolds uses symplectic and algebraic  
geometry.</p>
<p>In dimensions larger than 4 surgery theory is used to reduce  
classification questions to questions in algebraic topology and  
quadratic forms.</p>
