Spin and String(?) Geometry
<p>&nbsp;</p><p /><h4>Abstract:</h4>
<p>

In mathematics, one often wants to know what kinds of geometry can be
put on a manifold.  Specifically, when can a manifold be positively
curved?  We will see that if the manifold has a spin structure, then an
interesting blend of topology and analysis (index theory) gives a very
useful obstruction to positive scalar curvature metrics.  We will then
discuss an analogous situation when the manifold has a string
structure.  In this case, there is a conjectured obstruction to having
positive Ricci curvature.  I will not be assuming any knowledge of the
words in this abstract (except mathematics).</p>
