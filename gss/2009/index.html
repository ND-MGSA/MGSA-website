    <dd>An Introduction to Using Beamer</dd>

    

    <dt><b>Abstract</b></dt>
    <dd>Beamer is one of the more commonly used LaTeX packages for making presentations.  We'll discuss the basics of using it, as well as a couple of useful tricks.

    <dd>Variations on a theme of Helly</dd>

    
    <dt><b>Abstract</b></dt>
    <dd>Helly's Theorem, proved by Eduard Helly in 1923, is a result in convex geometry dealing with the intersections of certain families of sets.  While Helly's Theorem is rather useful on its own, by weakening its requirements we can broaden its applications to a surprising variety of problems.  Topics covered may include (p, q)-properties, fractional Helly properties, VC dimension, the arrangement of sheep, art gallery problems, and robots.

    <dt><b>Title</b></dt>
    <dd>Cayley-Bacharach Theorem through the ages</dd>

    
    <dt><b>Abstract</b></dt>
    <dd>Much of algebraic geometry focuses on the vanishing locus of systems of polynomials, as well as, the polynomials that vanish on a certain subspace.  In this talk, I will discuss some of the major tools algebraic geometers use in studying these vanishing loci and polynomials while focusing on a classical result in algebraic geometry, the Cayley-Bacharach theorem.  I will discuss several different formulations of the Cayley-Bacharach theorem from its earliest roots in Pappus' Theorem (4th century AD), through the twentieth century.   This talk is based on the paper "Cayley-Bacharach Theorems and Conjectures" by D. Eisenbud, M.Green, and J. Harris.     </dd>

    <dd>On the Uniqueness of Solutions to the Burgers Equation in Sobolev Spaces</dd>

    
    <dt><b>Abstract</b></dt>
    <dd> It is shown that solutions to the Burgers initial value problem are unique in Sobolev Spaces $H^s$ for $s>3/2$. Using a modification of the Kato-Ponce commutator estimate, an energy estimate for the Burgers i.v.p  is derived; an application of Gronwall's inequality then yields the desired result. <br />

    <dd>Uniform Distributions Modulo 1</dd>

    
    <dt><b>Abstract</b></dt>
    <dd> A sequence of numbers is uniformly distributed modulo 1 when it "equally fills" every part of the unit interval.   Sequences with uniform distribution, particular those that are well distributed in their early elements, are useful in a variety of contexts.   In this talk I will define the concept of uniform distribution, and discuss some of its applications, such as in Diophantine approximation and numerical integration. </dd>

    <dt><b>Title</b></dt>
    <dd>General Abstract n-sense</dd>

    
    <dt><b>Abstract</b></dt>
    <dd> Since category theory was introduced in the 1940s by Eilenberg and MacLane, it has often been referred to as 'general abstract nonsense'. In this talk, we will delve into a deeper abstraction by looking at the idea of n-categories. We will examine some of the difficulties in defining a sufficiently general notion of an n-category and consider motivating examples in topology. In particular, we'll discuss how certain degenerate n-categories encode interesting structure and why Leinster says, "the world of n-categories is a mirror of the world of the homotopy groups of spheres."

    <dd>Counting Nilpotent Ideals of a Borel Subalgebra</dd>

    
    <dt><b>Abstract</b></dt>
    <dd> An important part of Lie theory is the study of the structure of Lie algebras.  In this talk we will learn some of the basic facts about this structure.  We will then count the number of nilpotent ideals of a Borel subalgebra of classical Lie algebras, $A_n$ and $C_n$.  It turns out that counting these ideals can be done using combinatorial techniques, in particular, Andr√©'s reflection.  This simple combinatorial method can be used to simplify arguments that normally require a great deal of theory. <br />

    <dd>Conway's Solitaire Army Problem</dd>

    
    <dt><b>Abstract</b></dt>
    <dd> Peg solitaire is a common single-player game played on a board where every position but one starts occupied by pegs, and the goal is to use horizontal and vertical "checkers" style jumps to eliminate all but one of the pegs. John Conway's aggressive modification of the game asks the question: Given an army with soldiers on the integer lattice points of the lower half-plane (the new board), how far above the x-axis can the army place a soldier using these jumps? We present his surprising answer using the beautiful idea of pagoda functions, and then discuss one of many extensions to the problem.
	<p>Surprisingly, very little mathematics beyond geometric series is needed, which should be a welcome respite at the end of the first day post-Spring Break. </p>

    <dt><b>Title</b></dt>
    <dd>We're All Mad Here:  The Mathematics of Lewis Carroll</dd>

    
    <dt><b>Abstract</b></dt>
    <dd> Renowned author and freelance mathematician Charles Dodgson authored many books and poems beloved by children everywhere.  While his works portray worlds of delightful fancy and humorous nonsense, his mathematical side runs deep in the core of all his literature, making these children's stories just as beloved by adults.  During this talk, we will explore several examples of the mathematics in Dodgson's works.  We will make sense of seemingly nonsensical arguments, demonstrating how interpretation of language affects arguments in symbolic logic.  We will consider a method for computing determinants created by Dodgson using adjugate matrices.  Finally, we will explore other paradoxes and syllogisms, making note of the historical impact they had in the logic and philosophy communities in the mid-nineteenth century.</dd>

    <dt><b>Title</b></dt>
    <dd>What can logic teach us about theorems of ordinary mathematics?</dd>

    
    <dt><b>Abstract</b></dt>
    <dd> Reverse mathematics is a sub-field of logic which seeks to classify theorems of ordinary mathematics according to the complexity of their proofs.

	<p>In algebra, we learn every field K has an algebraic closure F. Furthermore, we learn that K is isomorphic to a sub-field of F. Given a computable field, how complicated is F? How complicated is the isomorphic image I of K in F? If F is computable and I is not computable, then more proof-power is needed to produce I than to produce F. If we know that some I must exist, we can prove the existence of certain non-computable sets. In doing this, we have 'reversed' our proof, using the theorem of algebra to proving our set existence 'proof rule'.</p>

	<p>In reverse mathematics, we prove and organize this type of result using subsystems of second order arithmetic. Second order arithmetic is a system of formal logic where we can quantify over numbers and sets and do basic arithmetic. By using the close connections that many subsystems of second order arithmetic have to computability theory, we learn more about the computational complexity of standard theorems. This talk will introduce the tools, goals, and practice of reverse mathematics, with examples.</p>

	<p>No background in logic, algebra, or arithmetic is assumed.</p></dd>

    <dt><b>Title</b></dt>
    <dd>Independence Relations</dd>

    
    <dt><b>Abstract</b></dt>
    <dd> Given two elements in some mathematical structure, what should it mean to say that they are ``independent''?  Intutively this means the two elements are as free as possible.  This turns out to be a combinatorial question, and it will turn out that not every structure admits such a property.  No logic background will be assumed, and many examples will be provided.
