    <dd>An Introduction to the Algebraic Aspects of Conformal Field Theory and Applications</dd>


    <dt><b>Abstract</b></dt>
    <dd><p>Conformal Field Theory (CFT) is an attempt to unify all fundamental forces, including gravity, by modeling particles as vibrating strings.  In the genus-zero, two-dimensional setting, vertex operator algebras (VOAs) describe the particle interactions.   Independently from physics, VOAs were discovered in mathematics in the study of representations of infinite-dimensional Lie algebras and the Monster finite simple group.  This study led to the surprising connection between CFT, VOAs and number theory.  I will briefly give a flavor of some of the mathematics involved.

    <dt><b>Title</b></dt>
    <dd>2-Dimensional Topological Field Theories</dd>


    <dt><b>Abstract</b></dt>
    <dd><p>We will show that the notion of a topological field theory, in one of
its simplest variations (namely, 2-dimensional and oriented), recovers a
classical notion from algebra, that of a Frobenius algebra.  This fact
is a well-known “folk theorem” but, as we will see, it has a nontrivial
proof relying on Morse theory.

    <dt><b>Title</b></dt>
    <dd>A Primer on Pseudoholomorpic Curves</dd>


    <dt><b>Abstract</b></dt>
    <dd><p>I will begin with an overview of almost complex manifolds and complex manifolds. Next, I will define pseudoholomorphic curves (or (J-)holomorpic curves) and I will try to convince you that these are just the usual notion of a holomorphic function in a special case. After that, I will give some basic definitions in symplectic geometry and relations with almost complex structures. Finally, I will state some results in symplectic geometry which are applications of holomorphic curves, one of which can be thought of as a generalization of the Riemann Mapping Theorem.

    <dd>Singularity Theorems in General Relativity</dd>


    <dt><b>Abstract</b></dt>
    <dd><p>I will begin with a brief introduction to the language of General Relativity, including some examples
of spacetimes. After that, I will move on to discuss causality on such spacetimes, and finally try to
give a general idea of how Hawking’s and Penrose’s Singularity Theorems work.

    <dd> A Finite State Automaton For Coxeter Groups</dd>


    <dt><b>Abstract</b></dt>
    <dd><p>The problems of determining when two words represent the same element in the group and finding a
finite state automaton that recognizes the language of reduced words are fundamental ones in the
combinatorial group theory. Using the standard geometric representation and the theory of root
system, I will show that both problems can be solved for Coxeter groups. In particular I will show
how to construct such an automaton using a partial order structure
on the set of roots.

    <dd>Git: LaTeX's Best Friend</dd>


    <dt><b>Abstract</b></dt>
    <dd><p>Writing up a large project is complex business.  Multiple reorganizations can either lead to a mess of files with names like "thesis_rewrite2_september_with_changes.tex", or to being afraid to make big structural changes for fear of losing work.  And if you fix a typo in one version, it takes a lot of focus to always remember to fix it in every version you might use.  This whole situation is much worse if you have to deal with multiple authors, or keep track of one version for submission to journals and another as a dissertation.  Fortunately, there's a better way!  Git is free software written by Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux, to solve the very similar problems faced by a complicated software project with many contributors.  I'll show you how Git works and how to use it on your projects.

    <dd> Arrow’s Impossibility Theorem</dd>


    <dt><b>Abstract</b></dt>
    <dd><p>Social choice theory, an area of study closely tied to fields as diverse as mathematics, economics,
political theory, and philosophy, seeks to aggregate individual preferences into overall societal
preferences in order to aid the collective decision-making process within a society. Perhaps the most
famous and influential theorem in modern social choice theory is Arrow's Impossibility Theorem, or
Arrow's Paradox, which states that no social choice function which combines individual rank-order
preferences into a societal rank-order preference can simultaneously satisfy the following three very
minimal fairness and consistency criteria: the Weak Pareto Criterion, Independence of Irrelevant
Alternatives, and Nondictatorship. In this talk, I will discuss the mathematics underlying this famous
theorem, outline some of its economic and philosophical implications, and finally give a sketch of its
proof.

    <dt><b>Title</b></dt>
    <dd> Fourier Analysis and Zeta Functions </dd>


    <dt><b>Abstract</b></dt>
    <dd><p>We will be discussing the contents of the 1950 dissertation by John Tate entitled "Fourier analysis in number fields, and Hecke's zeta-functions". In this cult-classic paper Tate develops Fourier Analysis on the Real, Complex, and p-adic numbers simultaneously in the "local theory" to define local zeta functions. By carrying over the classical results like the Fourier Inversion Theorem and the Poisson Summation formula, one can derive a functional equation and analytic continuation for these local zeta functions. Afterwards the Adéles are introduced, a restricted direct product of all of the completions of the rationals, and the Fourier Analysis on this space of Adéles leads to a generalized proof of the functional equation and analytic continuation of the Riemann Zeta function as well as the Hecke zeta functions.
