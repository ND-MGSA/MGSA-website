    <dt><b>Title</b></dt>
    <dd>The &#8220;Happy End Problem&#8221; &#8212; A Mathematical Love Story</dd>
    
    <dt><b>Abstract</b></dt>
    <dd>
	<p>Given any 5 points in the plane, no three collinear, some
	4 of them must form the vertices of a convex quadrilateral.
	(Go ahead and convince yourself --- it's fairly easy).</p>

	<p>Now let's try to generalize. Is there an f(n) such every
	set of f(n) points in the plane, no three collinear,
	contains n points that form the vertices of a convex
	n-gon?</p>

	<p>This is the ``Happy End'' problem, posed in the early
	1930's. Its solution touches on topics from graph theory,
	logic and analysis, as well as giving rise to a love story
	that spanned over seventy years and two continents.</p>

    <dd>Monomial Ideals and the Core</dd>
    
    <dt><b>Abstract</b></dt>
    <dd>A monomial ideal in a polynomial ring R=k[X_1,..,X_d] is an ideal which can be generated by elements of the form X_1^{n_1}...X_d^{n_d}.  Such an ideal J can be represented as a region in $d$-space, which in theory allows us to describe how to get from J to other monomial ideals associated to J in a very combinatorial manner.  Two such associated ideals are the core of J and the $S_2$-ification of J.  I will define these ideals, discuss them a bit, and show some results I have for a particularly nice class of ideals in k[x,y]. Pictures will abound.

    <dt><b>Title</b></dt>
    <dd>The Random Graph is Simple</dd>
    
    <dt><b>Abstract</b></dt>
    <dd>There are many ways to define the random graph, but they all lead to 
the same, unique, structure. The first order theory of this structure gives a
class of structures which "look like" the random graph. However, while there
is a unique random graph, there are many, many look-a-likes in every
uncountable cardinality. This talk will show how the many different
look-a-likes come from the presence of a formula with the "independence
property"; that the random graph is the simplest theory exhibiting this
property; and, finally, survey other theories with this property. Also, the
negation of having the independence property has its own, profound,
consequences. All logic jargon will be explained, in patient, loving detail.

    <dd>Rock the Vote or Vote The Rock</dd>
    
    <dt><b>Abstract</b></dt>
    <dd>Is it possible for Dwayne Johnson (aka The Rock) to get elected
    president of the United States? Who would he have to pay off? We give a
    talk investigating mathematical aspects of counting votes. We hope to come
    to the conclusion that it is very well possible that The Rock could be
    elected president if he gets to choose HOW to count the votes.

    <dd>Umbilics, Lines of curvature and a conjecture of Caratheodory
</dd>
    
    <dt><b>Abstract</b></dt>
    <dd>We will introduce umbilics and discuss the structure of the lines
    of curvature around generic isolated umbilics. We will also discuss a
    conjecture attributed to Caratheodory which states that a smooth, convex
    embedding of the 2-sphere into R^3 has at least two umbilics. Finally, we
    will discuss the deep connection between the Caratheodory conjecture and
    Loewner's conjecture about the index of the vector field (&part;^2)&fnof;
    for C^2 functions &fnof; : {|z| &le; 1} to R. <br/>

    <dt><b>Title</b></dt>
    <dd>The Calculus on Time Scales</dd>
    
    <dt><b>Abstract</b></dt>
    <dd>We know how to differentiate and integrate continuous functions, and
    we can apply difference and summation operations on discrete functions,
    but what can we say when the domain of the function is more complicated?
    Could we write down general product, chain, integration by parts and
    substitution rules independent of domain? How about inequalities and
    dynamical equations? All these questions and more will be answered in this
    whirlwind tour of Hilger's work towards unifying discrete and differential
    calculus.

    <dt><b>Title</b></dt>
    <dd>Manifolds and the Shape of the Universe</dd>
    
    <dt><b>Abstract</b></dt>
    <dd>An n-manifold is a topological space that locally just looks like n-dimensional Euclidean space.  For example, the surface of the Earth is a 2-manifold since if I am standing on the Earth and look around me, it just looks like I am standing on a 2-dimensional plane.  Meanwhile, the spatial universe in which we live appears to be a 3-manifold since every part of the universe that we have seen so far has locally looked like 3-dimensional Euclidean space.  However, which 3-manifold is the universe?  This question is not easy to answer, but recent experimental evidence suggests that there are only 10 possibilities.</dd>

    <dd>An Applied Mathematics Perspective on Blood Clotting</dd>
    
    <dt><b>Abstract</b></dt>
    <dd>Hemostasis is the complex process by which the human body halts the loss of blood through clotting. The formation and eventual lysis (breaking up) of a clot is dictated by a multitude of factors, including chemical processes, cellular components, and the flow of blood through the vessel. By using a combination of differential equations and probabilistic approaches, we have begun to create a model which can allow us to better understand this biological phenomenon.</dd>

    <dt><b>Title</b></dt>
    <dd>A Mathematical Introduction to Quantum Field Theory</dd>
    
    <dt><b>Abstract</b></dt>
    <dd>In this talk we describe field theories based on the axioms of Atiyah and Segal.  Motivated by physics, field theories have become a valuable mathematical topic.  Recently, Lurie, Stolz, Teichner and others have used field theories to study higher category theory as well as generalized cohomology theories.  This talk will build up to this relation between field theories and cohomology.</dd>
