<h3>Graduate Student Seminar, 4:45pm November 10, 2003</h3>
<p><h4>Speaker:</h4>Wesley Calvert</p>
<p><h4>Title:</h4>The Structure of Abelian Groups</p>

<p><h4>Abstract:</h4>
<p>Most of us know that any finitely generated Abelian group is a direct sum
of cyclic groups (finite or infinite).  When I first saw this theorem, I
asked, "What about the rest?"  This is not meaningless abstraction: some
of our favorite groups do not have this form (the additive group of
rationals, for instance).</p>

<p>It turns out that a great deal is known about the structure of Abelian
groups in general.  Every Abelian group splits into a torsion part and a
torsion-free part.  The torsion part is completely understood.  The
torsion-free part can be a good deal more complicated, and it is in the
more exotic corners of torsion-free Abelian group theory that we find the
few remaining open problems in the classification of Abelian Groups -- and
some truly remarkable techniques.</p>

<p>This talk will outline the classification of Abelian groups to the extent
that it is known.  I will also tell about recent progress on the last
frontier, where the tools used include both computable model theory and
ergodic theory.</p>
