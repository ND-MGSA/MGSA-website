<h3>Graduate Student Seminar, 4:45pm September 29, 2003</h3>
<p><h4>Speaker:</h4>Rebecca Weber</p>
<p><h4>Title:</h4>What I did on my Summer Vacation</p>
<p><h4>Abstract:</h4>
</p>

My thesis problem is to show that two logical structures are 
isomorphic, one a long-studied structure (<IMG

 ALT="$\mathcal{E}^*$">) and one a 
very new structure (the fabled <!-- MATH
 $G^\diamondsuit$
 -->
<IMG
 WIDTH="27" HEIGHT="17" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="webimg2.gif"
 ALT="$G^\diamondsuit$">).  My talk will 
introduce the two structures and discuss why the question of their 
isomorphism is interesting.  No logic background will be assumed.
