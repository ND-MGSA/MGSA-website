<h3>Graduate Student Seminar, 4:45pm October 27, 2003</h3>
<p><h4>Speaker:</h4>Julie Bergner</p>
<p><h4>Title:</h4>A Taste of Homotopy</p>
<p><h4>Abstract:</h4>
In this talk I will begin by introducing the basic concepts of homotopy theory of topological spaces.  From there I
will take brief excursions into ideas that have developed from them, such as stable homotopy theory, model category
structures, and simplicial objects. </p>
