<h3>Graduate Student Seminar, 4:30pm January 19, 2004</h3>
<p><h4>Speaker:Keith Hubbard and Ben Jones</h4>
</p>
<p><h4>Title:</h4>
Lie groups, Lie algebras and invariants
</p>

<p><h4>Abstract:</h4>
Lie groups and Lie algebras show up in nearly every corner of mathematics from
math physics to topology to number theory.  We will give basic definitions and
examples of both, and provide additional applicable banter.   We will then
investigate the correspondence between simply connected Lie groups and finite
dimensional Lie algebras, as well as simple descriptions of their invariants
without losing information.
