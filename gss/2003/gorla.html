<h3>Graduate Student Seminar, 5:00pm April 30, 2004; HH127</h3>
<p><h4>Speaker:</h4> Elisa Gorla
</p>
<p><h4>Title:</h4>
Curves, general plane sections and cohomology
</p>

<p><h4>Abstract:</h4>
I will discuss what one can say about a curve in projective space by looking at its general plane section, i.e. its
intersection with a general plane. I will try to motivate why looking at a general section makes sense in our contest,
and how it relates to vanishing of the first cohomology of the ideal sheaf of the curve.
