<p><h4>Title:</h4>
"Nerve"-Racking Topology
</p>

<p><h4>Abstract:</h4>
The concept of a nerve, a simplicial complex formed from a family of objects by
taking sets that have nonempty intersections, comes up in various guises in
mathematics.  In this talk, I will address two such applications that relate to
topology: the nerve of a cover, used to calculate Cech homology, and Segal's
nerve of a topological group, used to construct classifying spaces.
