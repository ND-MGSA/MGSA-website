<h3>Graduate Student Seminar, 4:30pm September 15, 2003</h3>
<p><h4>Speaker:</h4>Phillip Harrington</p>
<p><h4>Title:</h4>Pseudoconvexity and Subellipticity</p>
<p><h4>Abstract:</h4>
<p>Pseudoconvexity plays a central role in the theory of several complex
variables, since pseudoconvex domains are the most natural domains for the
study of holomorphic functions in several variables.  However, there are
many gradations of pseudoconvexity, with some more amenable to study than
others.  I will begin my talk by characterizing the various types of
pseudoconvex domains, with some hints as to the problems posed by "weaker"
forms of pseudoconvexity.</p>

<p>The use of PDEs to study pseudoconvex domains leads naturally into the study
of subelliptic operators.  Roughly speaking, these are differential
operators where the solution is more regular than the data, but without the
best regularity that one could hope for (as in the case of elliptic
operators).  In the second part of my talk, I will introduce elliptic
operators and subelliptic operators in more detail, and talk about the
relationship between pseudoconvexity and subellipticity for the d-bar
Neumann problem.</p>
