<h3>Graduate Student Seminar, 4:30pm February 16, 2004; HH127</h3>
<p><h4>Speaker:</h4>Thanasak Mouktonglang </p>
<p><h4>Title:</h4> Optimization: Introduction to Interior-point methods, and primal-dual algorithms
</p>

<p><h4>Abstract:</h4>
Linear programming has been the dominant paradigm in optimization since the
development of simplex method in 1940s.  In 1984, the paper by Karmarkar
started a new area of research for a new class of method known as
interior-point method, and in the decade since then primal-dual algorithms have
emerged as the most important and useful algorithms from this class.
I first talk about a general optimization problems.  Some important
terminologies will be introduced.  Then I'll quickly talk about
Linear-programming problems, Second-order cone programming problems,
Semidefinite-programming problems and how to solve them.  Then if time is
permitted, I'll end with a cool application of semidefinite programming
problems.
