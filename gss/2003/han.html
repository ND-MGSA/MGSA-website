Guangyue Han</p>
<p><h4>Title:</h4>Multiple Antenna System and Packing on U(n)
</p>

<p><h4>Abstract:</h4>
In this talk I will first talk about elements about the communication theory and
modulation method, using an example of AWGN channel and PSK constellation. 
Then the problem will be posed for MIMO fading channel and the design criterion
for this kind of channel will be presented. Using the packing techniques on the
Lie group U(n), an upper bound of the diversity will be discussed.</p>
