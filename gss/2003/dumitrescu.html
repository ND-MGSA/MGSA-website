<p><h4>Title:</h4>Morse Theory and Floer Homology
</p>

<p><h4>Abstract:</h4>
Morse theory is presented from the perspective of topological field theory,
approach developed by Witten.  Start with a space and a "nice"
function on the space, called Morse function, and by some counting
procedure  you obtain all what you wanted to know (topologically) about
your space (and even more). This approach will serve as a model for
defining (symplectic) Floer homology.
