<p><h4>Title:</h4>Can one hear the shape of a drum?</p>
<p><h4>Abstract:</h4>
<p>   In 1966, Mark Kac posed the following question: "Can one hear the shape of a
drum?". He had in mind the following problem: View the surface of a drum as a
plane domain M, and say that $\lambda$ is in the spectrum of M if exists a
nonzero
function f with $\Delta f = \lamda f$ and f=0 on the boundary. These
eigenvalues determine the frequency of sound provided by M. If you could "hear"
the spectrum of M what geometrical information can you obtain about M?</p>

<p>   We will answer this and many other related questions and try to give a
survey of the field known as Spectral Geometry. We shall discuss the beautiful
result of Sunada and Buser's example which were a key development to Carolyn
Gordon's answer to Kac's question. It is important to notice that a lot of work
in this subject is done in the compact case. We will address the noncompact
case and see what are the appropriate questions and current developments.
