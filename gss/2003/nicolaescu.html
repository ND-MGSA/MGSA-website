<h3>Graduate Student Seminar, 4:30pm September 3, 2003</h3>
<p><h4>Speaker:</h4>Liviu Nicolaescu</p>
<p><h4>Title:</h4>The many  faces of the Gauss-Bonnet theorem</p>
<p><h4>Abstract:</h4>
The Gauss-Bonnet  theorem, like few others  in
geometry,   is the  source of many fundamental  discoveries which
are  now part of the everyday language of the modern geometer.
This is an informal survey   of  some of the most  fertile ideas
which  grew  out of the attempts to better understand the meaning
of this remarkable  theorem.
